# Startup-Investments-Analysis-Portfolio

A startup's financing cycle includes typical stages as: 
1. Seed/Angel funding round: the startup raises the first flows of capital for its first few years of operation
2. Series A: the startup survives the first years and wants more funds to expand its business
3. Series B+: the startup continues to raise larger funds from bigger investors
4. IPO: a method of exit which happens when the startup has been extremely successful, and decides to sell its shares to the public.
 
It's revealed in the dataset that only 13% of all startups raising funds in Angel were able to advance to Series A. What can possibly go with a company's higher conversion rate in early-stage fundraising?
